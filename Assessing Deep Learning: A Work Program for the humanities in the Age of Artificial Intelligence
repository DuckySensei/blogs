AI BLOG
By DYLAN and Mickey and Asghar


	This is a short blog following reading the “Assessing Deep Learning: A Work Program for the humanities in the Age of Artificial Intelligence”.
There were three points I wanted to express about this article that stood out above the rest.

The first of which I wanted to talk about is AI and human worth. An experiment was performed where AI was tasked with trying to solve a problem only thought to be solvable
by humans. Surprisingly AI swiftly solved this problem leading some baffled and some feeling distraught at the idea that AI would be able to unfortunately take over society
as we know it. With this, a question is raised. Should we be worried about the potential of AI making human intelligence obsolete? I don’t believe so. Something the article
talks about is how is the limits of the DL system and how, even though this AI solved questions only thought to able to be solved by humans, it is also emphasized that this
AI had weak Common-Sense Reasoning. This AI struggled with comprehending basic human emotions such as joy and humor. Emotionally decision-making is based solely on learned
pattern from data. Tasks that require empathy, or ethical consideration are areas where this system fell short. What I believe is the most profound limitation of the DL
system lack self-awareness. These examples are all to say that we shouldn’t feel belittled by DL’s AI system. 

The second point I wanted to talk on how DL challenges the capacity of human intelligence.This article seems to imply that task specific knowledge will become obsolete with
AI because it will can be used to quickly solve problems and increase productivity. The question asked Is will AI forever change the academic standards for what and how we
learn? In short, yes. The reason I feel this question is obviously a yes is because already our academic standards have changed. ChatGPT and OpenAI being outlined as tools
that shouldn’t be used in the classroom setting. But I think it’s very interesting to claim that we would be learning differently. And after discussing this idea with a
fellow classmate and my teacher, I think this is true. The pro’s of learning with AI is that you are able to find and work with information at a pace quicker then ever
seen before. But the downside of such is that now, I never need to look deeper into questions and really connect pieces to solve problems. I feel like AI starts to
undermine the fundamentals.

	Overall, AI is a tool that we should use and act cohesively with, It’s very important that we recognize the potential good and advancements that come with AI being
developed. And we remain cognizant of the individuality that we have and the human interactions that AI cannot replicate!
